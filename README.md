# 2kRP Project

This project intends to add Discord Rich Presence compatibility for Yume 2kki on the navigator (not the desktop application).
It utilizes a browser extension to act as a "linker", sending necessary data to a receiver app in the desktop through a localhost connection. The presence is then updated for the connected client using pypresence.

## Project Structure

- `2kRP_Extension/`: Contains the browser extension files.
- `2kRP_Presence/`: Contains the rich presence application. Also responsible for the local server.

## Installation

### Requisites

- Python 3.x
